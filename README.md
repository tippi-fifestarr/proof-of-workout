git add .
a simple proof-of-concept, front-end still needs to add function to Verify (✔️) and Reject (X).  
I'd like to add a border around fully verified videos (and maybe remove the vote buttons?)
When the threshold is reached, if your account is the one that made the video, show a button "Mint NFBody"
For the backend, still want to add an incentive layer such as removing the rejected ones, requiring a vote deposit (like staking your vote) which gets distributed to the good voters if your vote is vetoed by majority.
The biggest incentive could be NFT NFBody reward for having your video verified 3 times.
